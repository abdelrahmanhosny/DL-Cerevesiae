Recently, the approach has changed to a computational paradigm, where scientists try to model these biological processes as mathematical equations or statistical models. In this study, we have modeled an important activity of cell replication in a type of bacteria genome using different deep learning network models. Results from this research suggest that deep learning models have the potential to learn representations of DNA sequences, hence predicting cell behavior.\r\n\r\n### Models Trained\r\n* Basic Recurrent Neural Network\r\n* Long Short Term Memory\r\n* Gated Recurrent Unit\r\n* Restricted Boltzmann Machine\r\n* Deep Belief Network\r\n* Auto-encoder\r\n\r\n### Experimental Results\r\nSee the source code on the repository.
